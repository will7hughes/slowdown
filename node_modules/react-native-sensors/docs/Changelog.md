## Version 5

### 5.1.0

We added experimental support for the Barometer, it can be used like this:

```js
import { barometer } from "react-native-sensors";

const subscription = barometer.subscribe(({ pressure }) =>
  console.log({ pressure })
);
```

Please help us improve the quality by using this sensor and giving feedback!

### 5.0.0

In this release we defined a whole new API that does not rely on promises anymore.
To migrate please also update RxJS to a version greater than 6.

#### RxJS

```diff
- import { Accelerometer, Gyroscope } from "react-native-sensors";
+ import {
+   accelerometer, // direct access to the observables
+   gyroscope,
+   setUpdateIntervalForType, // set update interval globally
+   SensorTypes
+ } from "react-native-sensors";

+ // update to RxJS >= 6
+ import { map, filter } from "rxjs/operators";
- let accelerationObservable = null;
- new Accelerometer({
-  updateInterval: 400 // defaults to 100ms
- })
-  .then(observable => {
-    accelerationObservable = observable;

    // Normal RxJS functions
-    accelerationObservable
-      .map(({ x, y, z }) => x + y + z)
-      .filter(speed => speed > 20)
+   const subscription = accelerometer.pipe(
+         map(({ x, y, z }) => x + y + z)
+         filter(speed => speed > 20)
+       )
-      .subscribe(speed => console.log(`You moved your phone with ${speed}`));
+      .subscribe(speed => console.log(`You moved your phone with ${speed}`), error => {
+        console.log("The sensor is not available");
+      });
-  })
-  .catch(error => {
-    console.log("The sensor is not available");
-  });

setTimeout(() => {
-   accelerationObservable.stop();
+   subscription.unsubscribe();
}, 1000);
```

#### Decorator

We dropped support for the decorator syntax as it added a lot of testing surface.
Please use libraries like [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) with `componentFromStream` to fill the gap. If you need help with this feel free to open an issue and we will provide more context and guidance.

## Version 4

* [Do not convert errors to return values](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/157)
* [Do not crash iOS Simulator](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/151)

## Version 3

### 3.1.0

* Add Semantic Release

### 3.0.0

* [Magnetometer](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/62) support
* [Add linking failure message](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/61): If you forget to link the native dependencies you now get `"Native modules for sensors not available. Did react-native link run successfully?"` as an error
* [Fix sensor availability checks](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/60)
* [Fix startup API](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/56)
* BREAKING: [removed windows support](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/commit/2c347ae93db97274f14f8d2b3fb15daf72c6eebe) We had to remove the windows support as there was no one maintaining it. If you have interest in using this library on a windows phone, please leave an issue. We would be very happy to revert this commit and get windows up to speed again.
* BREAKING: [Check if sensor is supported](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/issues/28) You can now check if a sensor is available on the device. This changed the API, therefore it's a breaking change. Special thanks to @dabit1 for introducing this much needed functionality.

### 3.0.0-2

* [Magnetometer](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/62) support

### 3.0.0-1

* [Add linking failure message](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/61): If you forget to link the native dependencies you now get `"Native modules for sensors not available. Did react-native link run successfully?"` as an error
* [Fix sensor availability checks](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/60)
* [Fix startup API](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/56)

### 3.0.0-0

* BREAKING: [removed windows support](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/commit/2c347ae93db97274f14f8d2b3fb15daf72c6eebe) We had to remove the windows support as there was no one maintaining it.

## Version 2

### 2.4.1

* [Restore the original api](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/36) <- fix for unintentional change of our API by @epeli

### 2.4.0

* [Move from `React.PropTypes` to `prop-types`](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/33)
* [Throw error instead of crash if a certain sensor is missing](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/pull/32) <- This caused an unintenional change in our API
